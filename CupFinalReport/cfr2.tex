\subsection*{NEXT}

The scientific and technical activities of NEXT are carried out in the context of an international collaboration which includes the members of the CUP consortium but also other international members, such as the groups from Portugal, Colombia and the US. 

The leadership of the collaboration rests largely in Spanish groups, and in particular in the leading groups in the CUP consortium. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
\item The spokesperson (J.J. Gomez-Cadenas) is a member of the IFIC group.
\item The hardware project manager (J.F. Toledo) is a member of the UPV.
\item The software project manager (J.A. Hernando) is a member of the U. Santiago (US).
\item The technical coordinator (F. Monrabal) is a member of U. of Texas at Arlington and a former Ph.D. student of NEXT.
\item The analysis convener (M. Sorel) is a member of IFIC.
\item The software coordinator (P. Novella) is a member of the IFIC. 
\item The radiopurity coordinator (S. Cebrian) is a member of U. Zaragoza.
\item The integration manager (J. Torrent) is a member of U. Zaragoza.
\item The DAQ coordinator and the Slow Control coordinators are member of the UPV.
\item The project leaders of detector construction are members of IFIC and UPV.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{CAFE: Scientific activity}

As can be seen from our publication list there are regular
collaborations between the scientists in UB, IFIC and UAM. 
The members in the three groups in CAFE are all involved in the European
networks mentioned listed above. 


\section{\bf \textsf{Collaborations with other groups of research}}
\label{sec.others}


\subsection*{NEXT}

The international part of the NEXT collaboration has played a very important role in the dynamics of the experiment. In particular, the impact of the US groups cannot be overemphasised. Prof. D. Nygren was the inventor, in the mid seventies, of the TPC technology which constitutes the backbone of both the NEXT and EXO experiment (together with many other experiments in underground physics, nuclear physics and high energy physics). Nygren is a recipient of numerous prices and awards, a long-time distinguished scientist at Berkeley (now holding a chair at U. of Texas at Arlington) and one of the most influential scientist of his generation. The late prof. J. White was a World expert in high-pressure xenon chambers, and his expertise was essential to build the NEXT-DEMO detector.

The Spanish group at IFIC, UPV and elsewhere, benefited enormously from the experience, know-how and ideas of this two leading scientist and their teams. Furthermore, NEXT has been collaborating with scientists from Fermilab national laboratory. NEXT has been presented to the Nuclear Science Committee (NSAC) and has deserved excellent review
\footnote{\url{http://science.energy.gov/np/nsac/
}}

The US groups have contributed also importantly to the funding of the experiment, with man power and contributions in cash and equipment, currently at the level of $\sim$300 k\euro. 

The Portuguese groups have also contributed with their know-how (the groups of Coimbra and Aveiro are recognised experts in the field) and have lead several important studies in connection with energy resolution and gas mixtures. The Russian group from Dubna was essential for the procuration of the 100 kg of enriched xenon owned by the LSC and necessary for the experiment (the current cost of enriched xenon is five time the cost payed in 2011). Last, but not least, the group from A. Nari\~no (Colombia) is contributing in several aspects of software and DAQ. 

{\em The success of NEW and a clear message of support from the Spanish authorities would be instrumental in enlarging the NEXT collaboration}. The construction and full commissioning of the NEXT-100 detector could benefit enormously from a stronger international collaboration, and the costs could be shared among more partners. 

\subsection*{CAFE}

We have ongoing collaborations with scientist in major institutions
and laboratories worldwide as can be deduced from our list
of publications. Just to mention a few: CERN, Fermilab (USA), 
INFN-Frascati (ITALY), Gran Sasso (Italy), Max Planck Institute (Germany),
Stony Brook Univ (USA), U. Wisconsin (USA), and, U. Sao Paulo (Brazil). 

\section{\bf \textsf{Collaborations with companies}}

The NEXT project has relations with a large number of companies. Among these:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hamamatsu Photonics and SENSL, for sensor developments (radiopure PMTs, radiopure SiPMs). We have an on-going collaboration with both companies, in particular to develop ultra-pure SiPMs.
\item Linde, Air Liquide and Swagelock, concerning gas system developments. 
\item ACYM and other pressure vessel manufacturing companies. 
\item SCIENTIFICA and AVS, which are science-related companies with whom we have also collaboration agreements.

\section{\bf \textsf{Problems and suggestions}}

\label{sec.problems}

The Consolider CUP, together with the AdG from the ERC and the support of the SEIDI has made possible to launch the NEXT experiment. NEXT is the flagship experiment at the LSC, as clearly recognised by the LSCSC (see appendix A), and its success will be a tremendous boost for the credibility and visibility of our laboratory. NEXT has a large discovery potential and is considered one of the most relevant technologies for the future of t\bbonu\ searches. Very likely there will be a ton-scale HPXe experiment searching for \bbonu\ events in the next decade. Having launched the NEXT program, Spain is in a perfect position to host such a large-scale experiment, involving a large international collaboration at the LSC, leading the field. 

However, the project still faces difficulties in Spain. A large experiment like NEXT requires a stable funding scheme like the CONSOLIDER program which is, alas, extinct. CUP made possible the creation of groups of young scientists and engineers at the consortium's institutions. In particular the IFIC group includes about 5 post-docs and 5 engineers who play leading roles in the development of the experiment. None of these people have permanent positions. Their salaries are payed either by a SEIDI grant or by the ERC grant. In the medium term this situation is not sustainable. If the IFIC group dismembers due to lack of funds or to lack of long-term prospects for the physicists and engineers working there, the know-how and capability to lead the field will be lost and the experimental push at the LSC will stale. Another opportunity for Spanish science will be squandered. 

NEXT is one of our few cases of an international experiment being led by Spanish physicists and conducted in Spain. NEXT has also attracted considerable external funding and prestige, as is the case also with CAFE. The two projects together participate or have participated in 6 EC projects (LAGUNA-LBO, Euro-$\nu$, INVISIBLES, INVISIBLES-PLUS, ELUSIVES and the AdG). 
%However, NEXT has faced the difficulties already discussed which may not be totally solved. 
In addition NEXT is already producing technological spinoff, with the proposal of PETALO, a PET based in liquid xenon which has generated already a patent and two scientific publications\footnote{See \cite{Petalo2015}, \cite{Gomez-Cadenas:2016mkq}} and is attracting considerable national and international attention. 



In conclusion, we believe that both CAFE and NEXT have fulfilled the promise of excellence associated to the CONSOLIDER program, generating scientific and technological spinoffs as well as international funding. We hope that this effort may be continued successfully in the forthcoming future. We suggest that a long--plan term for the LSC and its experimental effort is needed.

\section{\bf \textsf{Appendix B: The EL choice}}

In this appendix we summarise the main arguments to choose the EL technology for NEXT. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Energy resolution}. This is a crucial feature of any \bbonu\ experiment, and one of the main advantages
of NEXT over its competition (the other two experiments, EXO and KamLAND-Zen have respectively 4\% FWHM and 10\% FWHM resolution at \Qbb, while the EL option of NEXT yields $\sim$0.5 \% FWHM). The electroluminescent amplification of the signal, being lineal permits to achieve resolutions near the Fano factor {\em in gas xenon}. Any system that operates with non-lineal gain (e.g, with avalanche) as is the case of Micromegas, needs to face gain fluctuations, which spoil the resolution. The NEXT collaboration has measured the resolution that can be attained both in a EL and in a MM system. Indeed, NEXT-DBDM found a resolution near the Fano factor \cite{Alvarez:2012yxw},
($\sim$ 0.5 \% at \Qbb), while NEXT-DEMO has measured a resolution of $\sim$ 0.7 \% at \Qbb \cite{Alvarez:2012zsz, Alvarez:2013gxa, Lorca:2014sra}, all in pure xenon. Instead the NEXT-MM prototype, operating with a mixture of Xenon and TMA measures a resolution that extrapolates to 3.2 \% FWHM at \Qbb \cite{Gonzalez-Diaz:2015oba}.
\item {\bf Operation with a quencher}. It is very difficult to operate a gain system at high pressure with pure xenon, and indeed, the NEXT-MM prototype has operated with a mixture of xenon and trimethylamine (TMA). Indeed, as
demonstrated in \cite{Gonzalez-Diaz:2015oba} reduces the diffusion and introduces a beneficial Penning effect. On the other hand, it totally suppresses the primary scintillation light in xenon, thus killing the start-of-the-event signal 
($t_0$). Without $t_0$~the background of the experiment grows by a large factor, as understood since a long time
\footnote{See: R. Luescher et al. Phys. Lett. B434 (1998) 407;
J.C. Vuilleumier et al. Phys. Rev. D48 (1993) 1009.}. 
\end{itemize}

\section{\bf \textsf{Appendix C: NEXT schedule}}

A very important consideration in internationally competitive experiments is their schedule. In fact, this point 
has been recently discussed, in the context of doble beta decay experiments, by the European Consortium 
in Astroparticle Physics (see talk by A. Giuliani and summary talk by F. Linde in the APPECC Town Meeting 
2016 \footnote{\url{
http://app2016.in2p3.fr/programme.html}}). In summary, the committee considered that running and projected experiments, including NEW-NEXT,  
are in a comparable position to compete for scaling up to the future ton experiment. The evaluation of the next two 
years performance of the available technologies would be crucial to make the right choice. An international 
panel of experts will be appointed by APPEC to work out recommendations.

In more details, EXO has completed his physics run with an exposure of about 100 kg $\cdot$ year, and its sensitivity
is dominated by backgrounds. This is also the case of KamLAND-Zen (both experiments are based in
xenon and are the direct competition to NEXT). An HPXe offers better resolution and better control of
backgrounds. NEXT could improve the results of both EXO and KamLAND-Zen, and explore a region
not yet covered by the competition in only two years of run\cite{Martin-Albo:2015rhw}.
Xenon has the great advantage (compared with other technologies like germanium diodes or bolometers)
to be cheap and easy scalable. In fact, it appears clear that the choice of a technology for the
ton-scale will take a few years. It is also clear that a successful operation of NEW will already situate the
NEXT technology as one of the major alternatives for the ton scale.

%A consistent criticism to the NEXT project has been the schedule. Indeed, the initial ambition of having a fully operational 100 kg detector in 2014, has proven to be too optimistic. This is not unheard of in ambitious scientific projects (including the LHC, which started with about 8 years delay) but is important to understand the reasons and to assess the implications.

%The main reason why the initial schedule was unrealistic is that the project proposed the construction of a complex and technologically revolutionary machine, as is the NEXT detector, to be operated in a new underground laboratory. In 2010, nobody in the World had built a large HPXe-EL detector. There were only a few experts (among then the later and much missed prof. J. White) who had the knowledge and technical proficiencty to attack the problem. In Spain, the know-how was absent and the labs lacked all the specialised equipment and instrumentation. Indeed, the construction, commissioning and operation of NEXT-DEMO in only two years (the detector was fully operational in 2012) was considered a major feat (as for instance in the reports of the referees during the AdG evaluations of 2013, or the reports of the LSCSC). Scaling the technology from DEMO to NEXT-100, required solving additional problems and understanding radiopurity issues. It could had been attempted in a single step (as was the opinion of the US groups and also of the LSCSC) but the lack of support of FPA in 2011 made totally inviable that option. The collaboration decided, instead, stage the experiment, building first the NEW detector, which is currently being commissioned at the LSC.
%
%With hindsight we believe that the staging decision was correct. 
%and that the skepticism regarding the accelerated schedule initially intended was justified (leaving the collaboration, rather tan contributing to improve it and denying support to the effort, as was the FPA reaction is an altogether different matter). 
%The NEW stage has revealed not only technical issues best addressed by an intermediate detector, but also the need to develop carefully the major infrastructures (gas system, shielding, emergency recovery system, slow controls) needed by the NEXT-100 experiment. It is important to realise that the LSC laboratory is completely new and lacked, only a few years ago, the infrastructures and facilities available at other undergrounds labs such as the LNGS. Instead, the febrile activity associated to NEXT has been instrumental for the development of such infrastructures, that range from lead shielding to a state-of-the-art Radon abatement system. 
%%All this requires time. 
%Notice that the commissioning of NEW is also commissioning the infrastructures and services needed for NEXT-100. 
%
%Another major element is safety. It was recognised very early by the LSCSC that a deep risk assessment was necessary to operate a large high pressure system underground, but the LSC did not have a safety engineer until about one year ago. Safety studies could not have been conducted three years ago at the LSC due to the lack of personnel and proper protocol. Indeed, the quality of the laboratory has been improving along the development of the NEXT project. 
%
%The current schedule calls for NEW operation in 2016 and 2017. NEXT-100 can be built in one year, given the fact that the major infrastructures, slow controls and safety studies are in place and considerable expertise have been gained building NEW. However, the construction of the larger detector requires the full support from the Spanish system of science (NEXT needs sufficient support both in instrumentation investment and in personnel in 2019, when the ERC and current SEIDI grant runs out).  
%
%An argument often heard of is that NEW arrives late to the international competition. This is not the case as can be clearly seen in the recent presentation by A. Giuliani in the APPECC Town Meeting 2016\footnote{\url{
%http://app2016.in2p3.fr/programme.html}}. In fact, EXO has completed his physics run with an exposure of about 100 kg $\cdot$ year, and its sensitivity is dominated by backgrounds. This is also the case of KamLAND-Zen (both experiments are based in xenon and are the direct competition to NEXT). An HPXe offers better resolution and better control of backgrounds. NEXT could improve the results of both EXO and KamLAND-Zen, and explore a region not yet covered by the competition in only two years of run\cite{Martin-Albo:2015rhw}. 
%
%Xenon has the great advantage (compared with other technologies like
%germanium diodes or bolometers) to be cheap and easy scalable. In fact, it appears clear that the choice of a technology for the ton-scale will take a few years. It is also clear that a successful operation of NEW will already situate the NEXT technology as one of the major alternatives for the ton scale. 
% Science is a high-risk, high-reward business. We do believe that a discovery is still possible.
